 \item \textbf{Photodegradation of TMDCs} It has been known that TMDCs undergo faster degradation when exposed to laser light. Time-dependent PL and Raman hyperspectral images of heterostructure $\text{WS}_2-\text{MoS}_2$ were recorded and single frequency images were extracted from hyperspectral data cubes using Matlab. It has been shown that the interface between two materials plays as protective layer against degradation of the inner material. Far-field Cryogenic experiment has also been performed on the sample to understand PL emission of interface. 
                           \item \textbf{Microscope installation} In 2021 during lockdown due to Covid, we received the THz Near-field microscope. No one could come to the USA for installation. So I led the installation of the microscope from unboxing to the tests after installation.
