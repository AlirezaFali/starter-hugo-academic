summary: It has been known that TMDCs undergo faster degradation when exposed to
  laser light. Time-dependent PL and Raman hyperspectral images of
  heterostructure WS2-MoS2 were recorded and single frequency images were
  extracted from hyperspectral data cubes using Matlab. It has been shown that
  the interface between two materials plays as protective layer against
  degradation of the inner material. Far-field Cryogenic experiment has also
  been performed on the sample to understand PL emission of interface.
