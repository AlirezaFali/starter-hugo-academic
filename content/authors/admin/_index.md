I am an experimental physicist with seven years of experience in Nanophotonics and have several publications in prestigious journals, including Nature Communications, ACS Nano, and Nano Letters. I am an expert in different nano-characterization methods such as spectroscopy, TEPL, nano-imaging, optical microscopy, AFM, and nano-FTIR. I also have more than ten years of experience in Matlab for different applications such as data extraction from Hyperspectral images and calculations.
